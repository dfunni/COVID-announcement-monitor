#Palomar Observatory Monitor
This project monitors the Palomar Mountain Observatory website for updated
announcements. At the time of making the observatory was closed to the public
due to COVID-19. I wanted to be alerted as soon as the website was updated
to reflect a reopening.

This project has the following goals:
- Produce an alert when the Palomar Observatory is reopened
- Learn about html handling with beautiful soup
- Learn about autogenerating an email with SMTP
- Learn about containerizing code to run on raspi with minimal setup
